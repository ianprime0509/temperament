This is a library for working with [musical
temperaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_temperament) in JavaScript.
It was originally extracted from (and is used in)
[Temperatune](https://github.com/ianprime0509/temperatune), one of my other
projects. I figured it could be useful on its own to other developers, so I
made it into its own module.

## Installation

You can use NPM:

```shell
$ npm install --save temperament
```

or Yarn:

```shell
$ yarn add temperament
```

## Usage

The `Temperament` class encapsulates information about a temperament, providing
several methods for working with processed temperament data. The constructor
accepts a single argument, an object in the format described in the
[temperament format section](#temperament-format):

```js
import { Temperament } from 'temperament';

let equalTemperament = new Temperament(equalTemperamentData);
equalTemperament.setReferencePitch(441);
console.log(equalTemperament.getPitch('A', 4)); // Prints `441`.
```

In the above example, `equalTemperamentData` could be the object corresponding
to the sample given in the [basic usage section](#basic-usage).

Complete API documentation is generated by
[jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) from the
documentation comments in the source code, and can be found in the [`API.md`
file](API.md) in the project root.

## Temperament format

The format of a temperament is specified by the [JSON
schema](http://json-schema.org/) located in `src/schema.json`. Each item in
the schema is annotated with a `description` key that explains its purpose.

### Basic usage

Here is an example of a temperament file describing equal temperament:

```json
{
  "name": "Equal temperament",
  "referenceName": "A",
  "referencePitch": 440,
  "referenceOctave": 4,
  "octaveBaseName": "C",
  "notes": {
    "C": ["C", 0],
    "C{sharp}": ["C", 100],
    "D": ["C{sharp}", 100],
    "E{flat}": ["D", 100],
    "E": ["E{flat}", 100],
    "F": ["E", 100],
    "F{sharp}": ["F", 100],
    "G": ["F{sharp}", 100],
    "G{sharp}": ["G", 100],
    "A": ["G{sharp}", 100],
    "B{flat}": ["A", 100],
    "B": ["B{flat}", 100]
  }
}
```

All the keys used in the above example are required. The first key (and the
one whose purpose is most obvious) is the `name`: each temperament must have a
name which identifies it for use in other applications.

The next three keys describe the reference note. The reference note is
commonly the one used as a tuning pitch in an ensemble: in Western music, it is
typically A-4. The `referenceName` key gives the name of the reference note,
which must correspond to a key in the `notes` object, and the `referenceOctave`
key specifies the octave number of the reference note. Finally, the
`referencePitch` is the default value (in Hz) of the reference note's pitch.
The reference pitch may be configurable in user-facing applications, but you
should provide a reasonable default that corresponds to common usage. For
example, the reference pitch is specified above as 440 since most modern
players tune to a reference of 440 Hz.

The `octaveBaseName` is the name of the note that should be at the bottom of
each octave, and is used for octave numbering. The value of `octaveBaseName`
must correspond to a key in the `notes` object. In the example above, the
`octaveBaseName` is C, so the highest C below the reference pitch will be
labelled as C-4 and the lowest C above the reference pitch will be labelled as
C-5.

Finally, the bulk of the temperament is described in the `notes` object. The
keys in this object are note names, and the corresponding values define the
each note in terms of an offset (in
[cents](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)>)) from some other note. For
example, the entry `"F": ["E", 100]` above means that the note labelled F is
100 cents above the note labelled E. To avoid giving redundant information,
the entry `"C": ["C", 0]` ensures that note labelled C is defined, but does not
provide any information about its pitch since that information can be derived
from the other notes. In general, your temperament definition should have
exactly one note that is not defined relative to another note.

Conceptually, you can imagine the note information being used to deduce the
pitch of each note by starting at the reference pitch (which is already known)
and working outwards. For example, if we have the pitch of the reference note
A, then we can immediately deduce the pitches of B♭ (100 cents above) and G♯
(100 cents below). We can then continue this process to deduce the pitches of
B and G, and so on.

A note on octaves: an octave is defined to be 1200 cents, or a pitch ratio of
2:1. The notes that you specify in the `notes` object are assumed to fill a
_single octave_, meaning that the definition `"C{sharp}": ["C", 1300]` is
equivalent to the one given in the example above for C♯, since 1300 - 1200
is 100.

### Note name shortcuts

Certain special characters in note names can be replaced by sequences enclosed
in curly braces which can then be converted into special characters using the
`prettifyNoteName` function. Currently, only `{sharp}` (corresponding to ♯)
and `{flat}` (corresponding to ♭) are recognized. For example, the note name
`B{flat}` used in the sample above will be displayed as B♭. Of course, it is
also possible to simply type the Unicode characters directly into the
temperament file.

### Metadata

In addition to the required `name` key, there are several other keys which can
be used to add metadata to a temperament. Currently, the supported keys are as
follows:

- `description`: a longer description of a temperament. It is recommended to
  restrict this to a single sentence, with a period at the end.
- `source`: a description of the source from which the temperament data was
  obtained. For example, this could be a URL pointing to the Wikipedia page of
  your temperament or another page that describes it.
